Finally, as part of my javascript learning process, I'm here to make one more project.I've created a password generator project here where we may personalize our passwords.
We can quickly create a password that consists entirely of capital and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols like @, #, $, and so on.
and creating password combinations with capital, lowercase, digits, and symbols.
Since there are a lot of hackers on the internet these days who can easily steal weak passwords but cannot steal strong passwords, I decided to make a password generator app that allows us to personalize our passwords according to our needs.
I included a copy button in this project so that we could quickly copy our secure password from there.
 My goal is to develop low-latency web applications.
